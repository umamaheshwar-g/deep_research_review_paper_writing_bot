## 2. Background/Literature Review

The field of language models has evolved dramatically over recent years, driven largely by advancements in deep learning and increased computational power. Traditional autoregressive models, while effective, exhibited inherent limitations in managing long-range dependencies and maintaining structural integrity in generated text. The introduction of diffusion models aims to address these challenges by employing a novel framework that integrates latent variable approaches to text generation.

Diffusion models, originally inspired by processes in physics, employ a Markovian approach to transition between states of latent variables over time (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020). This concept has been successfully adapted for use in the discrete domain of language processing, where the manipulation of token embeddings allows for structured and coherent text generation. Early implementations of these models have demonstrated success in generating high-quality text, paving the way for further exploration within the field (Wang et al., 2023).

Their work illustrates how these models can outperform traditional methods in terms of fluency and coherence while providing a concrete foundation for future developments. Notably, local diffusion methods introduced by Kiritani and Kayano (n.d.) showcase their effectiveness in addressing hallucination issuesâ€”a common pitfall in large language models.

Recent advancements also point toward the integration of diffusion models with pre-trained language models (PLMs), unlocking new pathways for improving the generation quality of natural language tasks (Li et al., 2023). The synthesis of these two methodologies heralds a new era of NLP applications where text generation and contextual relevance are significantly enhanced.

As discourse surrounding ethical considerations grows, the need for awareness of issues like memorization and privacy concerns within large language models becomes increasingly pressing (Satvaty et al., 2024). This review draws attention to these concerns, ultimately advocating for responsible and transparent practices to guide future advancements in dLLMs.

In summary, the introduction of diffusion processes in language modeling signifies a paradigm shift within NLP. As researchers continue to navigate this evolving terrain, understanding these models' historical context, theoretical foundations, and practical implications will be crucial in striving to create more capable, reliable, and ethical language generation systems.
