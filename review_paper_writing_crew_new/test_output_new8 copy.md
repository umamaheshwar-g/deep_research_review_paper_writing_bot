### 1. Introduction  
The rapid evolution of natural language processing (NLP) has transformed the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs). While these models have shown exceptional capabilities, they are also associated with issues of undesirable memorization, which poses significant risks, particularly concerning privacy and safety in low-resource settings (Satvaty, Verberne, & Turkmen, 2024). This survey aims to consolidate recent advancements related to undesirable memorization in LLMs and investigate the developments surrounding diffusion-based LLMs as a potential solution to mitigate these concerns.

### 2. Background: Theoretical Foundations of Diffusion-Based Large Language Models (dLLMs)  

#### 2.1 Fundamental Concepts and Historical Developments  
Diffusion models have emerged as a substantial paradigm shift in generative modeling, transitioning from traditional autoregressive models to those that effectively manage discrete data like text. The foundational work in this area recognizes that diffusion models can model the gradual transformation of data distributions to enhance representation learning, resulting in elevated text quality (Wang, Li, & Li, 2023).

#### 2.2 Key Terminologies and Definitions  
Diffusion modeling hinges on several foundational concepts:  
- **Diffusion Process**: An iterative method that transitions noisy data into coherent outputs over specified time-steps (Li, Zhou, Zhao, & Wen, 2023).
- **Information Entropy**: A significant metric representing data uncertainty; its incorporation into diffusion processes can optimize model performance (Wang, Li, & Li, 2023).
- **Non-Autoregressive Generation**: Unlike previous models, dLLMs can generate text without relying on previously generated tokens, enhancing computational efficiency and output quality (Li, Zhou, Zhao, & Wen, 2023).

#### 2.3 Significant Milestones in the Field  
The evolution of diffusion-based models has showcased several critical milestones. Among them, the adoption of local diffusion mechanisms has garnered attention for addressing structural hallucinations in generated texts, significantly enhancing coherence and contextuality (Kiritani & Kayano, n.d.). This methodological innovation forms the backbone of many recent explorations in the field, aligning closely with the overarching concerns of memorization risks (Satvaty, Verberne, & Turkmen, 2024).

### 3. Thematic Analysis of Selected Studies  
Recent literature on dLLMs shows a pattern of thematic concerns, ranging from advancements in model frameworks to persistent challenges:

#### 3.1 Methodological Advances  
The adoption of non-autoregressive frameworks represents significant development. Studies emphasize transitioning towards models that effectively integrate information entropy, yielding enhanced text generation without compromising coherence (Wang, Li, & Li, 2023). The InfoDiffusion mechanism stands out for illustrating the relationship between information management and performance in text generation.

#### 3.2 Theoretical Perspectives  
The growing conversation surrounding undesirable memorization in LLMs underscores the models' risks, particularly in generating text that inadvertently diverges from safety standards (Satvaty, Verberne, & Turkmen, 2024). The impact of local diffusion techniques is increasingly recognized as a vital countermeasure to hallucination in LLM outputs (Kiritani & Kayano, n.d.).

#### 3.3 Applications and Implications  
Applications of diffusion-based models have shown promise in delivering coherent and context-sensitive outputs across diverse domains (Li, Zhou, Zhao, & Wen, 2023). However, the potential long-term implications of these models must be examined, particularly concerning operational efficiency and ethical data governance strategies that enhance information safety in generated content.
