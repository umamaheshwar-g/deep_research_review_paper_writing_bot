**1. Introduction**  
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), providing remarkable improvements in tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. These models, characterized by their extensive parameters and vast training datasets, offer unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. Yet, alongside their successes, significant challenges persist, particularly structural hallucination—where LLMs generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. This phenomenon poses critical issues for practical applications.

This review paper aims to synthesize the latest advancements in diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), emphasizing their potential to address the challenges of structural hallucination and undesirable memorization. The integration of diffusion methods has emerged as a promising avenue, with recent research highlighting their role in improving model performance and reliability. By analyzing the nuances of non-autoregressive text generation and applying principles of information entropy, this paper seeks to elucidate the transformative impact of diffusion processes on the state of LLMs.

**2. Background/Literature Review**  
The trajectory of LLMs can be traced back to the inception of statistical language modeling, with significant milestones achieved through foundational architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and the transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017). Despite their successes, traditional autoregressive models have limitations, particularly concerning coherence and factuality. The advent of diffusion-based models introduces new paradigms that diverge from traditional autoregressive frameworks.

Diffusion models offer a process where data is progressively transformed through a series of steps, enabling non-autoregressive generation capabilities. Recent contributions emphasize the significance of local diffusion techniques in improving the robustness of text generation. Additionally, the concept of information entropy has gained traction, leading to the development of methodologies that balance the diversity and relevance of generated text (Wang et al., 2023).

**3. Methodology Review**  

**3.1 Overview of Methodologies**  
In the exploration of dLLMs, various methodologies have emerged that leverage innovative approaches to tackle prevalent issues such as structural hallucination and undesirable memorization. Techniques such as local diffusion within existing frameworks have shown promise in enhancing reliability (Kiritani & Kayano, n.d.).

**3.2 Comparative Analysis**  
Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of local diffusion compared to traditional autoregressive models. The integration of pre-trained language models (PLMs) into diffusion frameworks serves as a complementary strength, enabling improvements in both quality and efficiency (Li et al., 2023).

**4. Thematic Sections**  

**4.1 Mitigation of Structural Hallucination**  
Research indicates that local diffusion techniques significantly reduce inaccuracies in LLM outputs, positively impacting metrics like precision and recall (Kiritani & Kayano, n.d.). These improvements are essential for applications requiring high accuracy, such as automated content generation and conversational agents (Satvaty et al., 2024).

**4.2 Non-autoregressive Text Generation**  
Non-autoregressive models operate by allowing simultaneous token generation, drastically improving efficiency while maintaining coherence. Recent studies demonstrate that this approach can lead to better performance outcomes than traditional methods (Li et al., 2023).

**4.3 Information Entropy in Diffusion Processes**  
The incorporation of information entropy principles has been shown to enhance the quality of text generation, thereby facilitating models that produce coherent and contextually relevant outputs. By examining the distribution of information in data, this approach enables improvements in text generation efficiency (Wang et al., 2023).

**4.4 Undesirable Memorization**  
Addressing undesirable memorization in LLMs brings forth ethical considerations related to privacy and content generation. The integration of diffusion strategies provides possible mitigations against exposing sensitive data (Satvaty et al., 2024).

**5. Discussion of Findings**  
The findings from various thematic areas reinforce the importance of integrating diffusion methodologies as a means to enhance performance and ethical considerations in LLMs. The ongoing challenges related to model interpretability and bias highlight the need for further research in this domain.

**6. Gaps and Future Directions**  
While considerable progress has been made, gaps exist in research focusing on low-resource languages and the ethical deployment of AI systems. Future work must address these limitations to ensure the inclusivity and reliability of dLLMs across diverse contexts.

Future directions should include:
- Exploring methods to adapt diffusion techniques for linguistic diversity.
- Investigating the implications of different retrieval architectures on memorization.
- Enhancing evaluation frameworks to incorporate ethical considerations.

**7. Conclusion**  
This review underscores a critical juncture in the study of diffusion-based language models, emphasizing the necessity for ongoing innovations that enhance performance while adhering to ethical practices. The insights gleaned from this review provide a platform for further exploration in the field of natural language processing.
